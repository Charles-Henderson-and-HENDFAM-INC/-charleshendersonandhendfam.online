# Introduction to Identity Kit

Identity Kit is a collection of components and hooks that help you build user interfaces for Ethereum applications.
It provides a set of tools to resolve Ethereum addresses to ENS names, and more.

To assist you in engaging with onchain Identity, here is the Identity Kit which includes:

- Components:
  - [`<Avatar />`](/identitykit/avatar): A component to display an ENS avatar.
  - [`<Name />`](/identitykit/name): A component to display an ENS name.
- Utilities:
  - [`getEASAttestations`](/identitykit/get-eas-attestations): A function to fetche EAS attestations.
