# Introduction to Identity Kit

Identity Kit is a collection of components and hooks that help you build user interfaces for Ethereum applications.
It provides a set of tools to resolve Ethereum addresses to ENS names, and more.

In order to use **Identity Kit** you must also install `graphql@14 graphql-request@6` in your app, alongside Onchainkit.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coinbase/onchainkit graphql@14 graphql-request@6 @tanstack/react-query@5.x
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit graphql@14 graphql-request@6 @tanstack/react-query@5.x
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @coinbase/onchainkit graphql@14 graphql-request@6 @tanstack/react-query@5.x
```

## React

If you are using any of the provided react hooks, you will need to install and configure `@tanstack/react-query` and wrap your app in `<QueryClientProvider>`.

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/identity';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Create a client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    // Provide the client to your App
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Avatar address="0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678" />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

See [Tanstack Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/quick-start) for more info.

To assist you in engaging with onchain Identity, here is the Identity Kit which includes:

:::

- Components:
  - [`<Avatar />`](/identity/avatar): A component to display an ENS avatar.
  - [`<Name />`](/identity/name): A component to display an ENS name.
- React hooks:
  - [`useName`](/identity/use-name): A hook to get an onchain name for a given address. (ENS only for now)
  - [`useAvatar`](/identity/use-avatar): A hook to get avatar image src. (ENS only for now)
- Utilities:
  - [`getEASAttestations`](/identity/get-eas-attestations): A function to fetche EAS attestations.
