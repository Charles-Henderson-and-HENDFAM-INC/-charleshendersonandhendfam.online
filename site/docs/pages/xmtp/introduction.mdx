# Introduction to XMTP Kit


[XMTP](https://xmtp.org/) is a wallet to wallet messaging protocol, and many XMTP client applications are adding Frames support.

XMTP Frames are designed to extend Frames and make them compatible with XMTP through the Open Frames [standard](https://github.com/open-frames/standard).

## Metadata

XMTP Frames are designed to be compatible with the Open Frames standard, and as such, they include a `metadata` field in the Frame `getFrameMetadata` response.

```ts
const frameMetadata = getFrameMetadata({
  /**
   * Frame metadata like Image, Buttons, Input, etc.
   */
  isOpenFrame: true,
  accepts: { xmtp: 'vNext' },
});

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  /**
   * ...other metadata
   */
  other: {
    ...frameMetadata,
  },
};
```
- `isOpenFrame`: A boolean that indicates whether the Frame is open or not.
- `accepts`: An object that indicates the versions of the Frame that the Frame supports.

## Handling XMTP Frames


When a user interacts with a Frame inside an XMTP client application, you will need to handle the payload slightly differently from an interaction coming from Farcaster. The primary identifier for a user on Farcaster is the `fid`, while in XMTP it is the `verifiedWalletAddress`.

In order to get the `verifiedWalletAddress` you must install `@xmtp/frames-validator` in your Frame, alongside Onchainkit.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

To assist you in handling interactions from XMTP, and extracting the `verifiedWalletAddress` from a POST payload, here is the XMTP Kit which includes:

- [XMTP Kit](/xmtp/introduction)
  - Utilities:
    - [`getXmtpFrameMessage`](/xmtp/get-xmtp-frame-message)
    - [`isXmtpFrameRequest`](/xmtp/is-xmtp-frame-request)
