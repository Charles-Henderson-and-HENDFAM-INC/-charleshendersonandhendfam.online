- **feat**: better treeshaking support by using **packemon**. By @zizzamia & @wespickett #105

BREAKING CHANGES

For modern apps that utilize `ES2020` or the latest version, breaking changes are not anticipated. However, if you encounter any building issues when using OnchainKit with older apps that rely on `ES6`, please open an issue and provide details of the error you're experiencing. We will do our best to provide the necessary support.
